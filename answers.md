## 1. Git vs Github:
- git is a version control system, which makes it easier for a team to keep track of changes and work 0n a project
- wheras github is more of a cloud based platform for hosting our repos. And once published on github, anyone can contributr=e to your project, depending on the visibility.

## 2. any 5 git commands
- **git clone** - is used to clone a repository
- **git branch** - is used to create a new branch
- **git merge** - to merge a branch into current one
- **git revert** - to revert/undo the changes
- **git status** - to know the current status of the repository
- **git commit** - to commit the changes
- **git pull** - to pull changes from remote repo into the local one
- **git push** - to upload changes from local to remote repo

## 3. How to make a pr:
1. Fork the repository you want to make pr to
2. create another branch to commit our changes onto.(since pull request can be made bw two diff branches)
3. make our changes and commit to that branch.
4. publish the branch( if it's on local repo)
5. make a pull request
